# WaterlooCarpool - ECE651 project
## Introduction
The UW Carpool Application is an app that helps users publish and search carpool information. It is designed to provide convenience and save time for users. Compared with bulletin board system (BBS) and Facebook Groups, the application can only display the specific carpool information based on usersâ€™ needs. Users no longer need to filter what they want from a variety of information.
